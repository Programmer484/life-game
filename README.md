# ai-first-starter

A TypeScript template built for agent-driven development. Architecture is
declared once in `module-map.json`; everything else — module boundaries,
scope enforcement, docs — follows from it.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm verify          # lint + typecheck + test + boundaries + coverage + dead-code, one exit code
```

## The idea

- **`module-map.json` is the single source of truth.** ESLint boundary rules,
  the scope resolver, and module docs are all generated from it. Change
  architecture in one file.
- **Modules have a public surface.** Other modules import a module only through
  its `index.ts`; `internal/` is private and deep imports fail lint.
- **Tasks are scoped.** `pnpm scope <module>` writes `.task/allowed-files.json`;
  a Claude Code hook blocks file-tool edits outside it and heuristically
  catches shell writes — a guardrail against accidents, not adversaries.
- **One gate.** `pnpm verify` runs locally and in CI and reports the same result.

## Common commands

| Command                           | What it does                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm new-module <name>`          | Scaffold + register a module (`--gates polish` skips coverage only) |
| `pnpm scope <module\|spec>`       | Write the allowed-files scope for a task (replaces any prior scope) |
| `pnpm scope --add <module\|path>` | Widen the current scope                                             |
| `pnpm verify`                     | Full quality gate, one exit code                                    |
| `pnpm verify --agent`             | Same gate, bounded failure summary + `.task/last-verify.json`       |
| `pnpm verify --baseline`          | On failure, classify each step as pre-existing vs introduced        |
| `pnpm pr "<title>"`               | Branch, commit, push, open a draft PR (runs verify first)           |
| `pnpm edit-log`                   | Print the last 20 run-ledger records from `edit-log.jsonl`          |
| `pnpm init:project <name>`        | Re-instantiate this template for a new project                      |

## Agent pipeline

Run `/feature <description>` in Claude Code, or follow the pipeline in
`.claude/commands/feature.md` manually: **scope → implement →
verify --agent → PR**. Agents should iterate with `pnpm verify --agent` —
same checks, bounded file-grouped output, machine-readable snapshot.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the rules and `TESTING.md` for the test playbook.
